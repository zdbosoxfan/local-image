# Asset attribution

Every asset shipped in this repository is listed here (see the asset rules in `AGENTS.md`). No asset may come from
Adobe products. Add an entry in the same commit as the asset.
`cargo xtask assets` (part of `cargo xtask ci`) fails if any image, icon, font, sound, video, raw file or colour profile
in the repository is not matched by a path pattern in the first column (`*` = any characters except `/`; a trailing `/`
covers a whole directory), or if a licence file referenced in the Licence column is missing.

Notes
- Fonts authored or published by Adobe (Source Sans/Serif/Code, Source Han, …) are not used, even though some are
  OFL-licensed: the asset rule excludes anything from Adobe. Source Sans 3 was removed on 2026-09-30 and replaced by Inter.
- Japanese fonts (BIZ UDPGothic, BIZ UDMincho, Shippori Mincho) are not in this repository. They live in
  [storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), with their licences and attribution in its
  `ATTRIBUTION.md`, and are embedded only in builds made with the optional `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR` build input (all official
  releases). Never commit font files here; add new fonts to craft-fonts (craftrules `standards/fonts.md`).
