# LightCraft — the desktop app (`lightcraft`) and the CLI/MCP server (`lightcraft-cli`), built from
# this repository:
#
#   nix build          # → ./result/bin/lightcraft, ./result/bin/lightcraft-cli
#
# Kept in step with the release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) and packaging/env.sh:
#   * `Cargo.lock` drives the dependencies (`cargoLock`), so there is no vendorHash to bump — only
#     crates.io, no git sources;
#   * `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR` embeds the CJK fonts from storytold/craft-fonts (the `craft-fonts`
#     flake input); without it everything builds and runs, but Japanese and Chinese text have no glyphs;
#   * the desktop file, hicolor icons and AppStream metadata are the same files the .deb/.rpm ship
#     (packaging/linux/), so `apt` and NixOS users see one identical LightCraft;
#   * `doCheck` runs `cargo test --workspace`, what `cargo xtask ci` runs. `nix build` runs it too;
#     `pkgs.lightcraft.overrideAttrs { doCheck = false; }` skips it for a faster, build-only install.
#
# Everything in the product is pure Rust (no C/C++ dependencies), so this needs no build system
# beyond cargo plus the windowing headers winit's build scripts look for.
