//! Photocraft in the browser.
//!
//! Runs the same [`photocraft_ui_egui::PhotocraftApp`] as the desktop app through eframe's web
//! runner (wgpu: WebGPU where available, WebGL2 otherwise). Build with `trunk build --release`
//! from this directory; see `docs/development.md` ("Web build").
//!
//! Differences from the desktop app:
//! - no TCP control server (browsers can't listen on sockets);
//! - File → Open uses the browser file picker; bytes arrive asynchronously through
//!   `Services::inbox`;
//! - saving/exporting triggers a browser download;
//! - dropped files are read asynchronously by `web::WebShell` and delivered through the inbox.
//!
//! URL query flags: `?cpu` forces the CPU canvas path (same as `PHOTOCRAFT_CPU_CANVAS=1`);
//! `?webgl` forces the WebGL2 backend instead of WebGPU.
