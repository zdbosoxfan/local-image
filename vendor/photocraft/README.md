## PSD without compromise

PhotoCraft's PSD support is a standalone crate written from Adobe's public specification and tested against a corpus of real-world files.

- **Faithful round trips:** opening and re-saving a document renders the same for 307 of the 309 files in the psd-tools test set and 169 of 170 in our mixed ag-psd/psd-tools set (`crates/io/tests/corpus.rs`; fetch the psd-tools set with `cargo xtask corpus --psd-tools`), and anything we don't model yet (raw blocks, descriptors, extras) is carried over instead of being dropped. A re-saved file is not byte-identical to its source: PhotoCraft rewrites image resources, layer records and the composite. Only the standalone `photocraft-psd` crate, parsing and writing a file without the document model, reproduces every parseable corpus file byte for byte (`crates/psd/tests/corpus.rs`).
- **Pixels that match:** a composite oracle compares our render with Photoshop's own merged image, covering gradient interpolation (Classic, Perceptual and Linear), layer effects, shape strokes, clipping and fill opacity.
- **Large documents:** PSB, 16 and 32-bit files, and CMYK and Lab documents open natively.

## Built for agents

Every menu item, tool and dialog runs a command from one registry of 500+ commands. The UI, the CLI, the JSON control channel and the MCP server all call the same commands, so anything you can click, a script or an AI agent can do too.

```sh
# Headless: open, edit, save
photocraft-cli run wave.psd \
  --cmd filter.sharpen.smartSharpen     --params '{"amount":80}' \
  --cmd layer.newAdjustmentLayer.curves --params '{"points":[[0,0],[64,48],[192,212],[255,255]]}' \
  --out wave-final.png

# Apply one action list to a folder of images
photocraft-cli batch --actions grade.json --in ./raw --out ./graded

# Every subcommand explains itself
photocraft-cli batch --help

# Let an agent drive it over MCP (headless, or bridged to the running app)
photocraft-cli mcp
```

The desktop app also offers an authenticated, loopback-only control channel (`photocraft --control`) for inspecting UI state, driving tools with pointer events, and taking offscreen screenshots. Every image in this README was rendered that way. See [`docs/control-protocol.md`](docs/control-protocol.md).

## Under the hood

- **Engine first:** a pure-data document model and a command engine, with a thin egui UI on top. Layering is enforced at build time across 24 crates.
- **Two compositors:** a CPU compositor serves as the reference oracle, and a wgpu compositor puts the canvas on the GPU. They are tested against each other.
- **Copy-on-write tiles:** 256² sparse tiles make undo cheap and huge canvases light, and effect maps are cached per layer state.
- **Runs in the browser:** the whole engine and UI compile to WebAssembly.
- **Clean-room:** implemented from public specs and observed behaviour only. No proprietary code, shaders or assets.
- **Tested:** more than 1,700 tests, including PSD round trips, synthetic generators, compositor oracles and multi-depth checks.

## Get started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/photocraft
cd photocraft
cargo run --release -p photocraft -- image.psd   # the desktop app
cargo test --workspace                           # the test suite
```

Japanese fonts for the UI and Type tool come from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), an optional build input (desktop release builds always include it). Without it PhotoCraft uses your system's CJK fonts:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts ../craft-fonts
CRAFT_FONTS_DIR="$PWD/../craft-fonts" cargo run --release -p photocraft
```

New contributors and AI agents: start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), then [`docs/`](docs/).

Installers for macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and the web are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft/releases). On Linux you can pick an AppImage, a `.deb`, an `.rpm`, a tarball or a Flatpak bundle. The bundle needs the freedesktop runtime from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/setup), which `flatpak` offers to install along with it:

```sh
flatpak install --user photocraft-<version>-linux-x86_64.flatpak   # or -linux-aarch64
flatpak run ai.storyteller.photocraft
```

The AppImage needs no install: the first run registers its launcher icon and menu entry in `~/.local/share` so the dock shows PhotoCraft's icon on Wayland. Set `PHOTOCRAFT_NO_DESKTOP_INTEGRATION=1` to skip that, and see [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) › Linux to undo it.

On macOS, the command-line tool comes as `photocraft-cli-<version>-macos-universal.zip`. The binary is signed with the same Developer ID as the app and notarized by Apple. A bare binary can't carry a stapled notarization ticket the way the DMG does, so the first time you run it macOS checks the notarization online. You can confirm it yourself:

```sh
ditto -x -k photocraft-cli-<version>-macos-universal.zip .
spctl --assess --type install -vv photocraft-cli-<version>-macos-universal/photocraft-cli
# ... accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
```

On FreeBSD 14 (x86_64), the release has a tarball laid out like `/usr/local`. Install the runtime libraries, then unpack it there:

```sh
pkg install libxkbcommon wayland libX11 libXcursor libXrandr libXi libxcb mesa-libs vulkan-loader gtk3 fontconfig freetype2 alsa-lib
tar -xzf photocraft-<version>-freebsd-x86_64.tar.gz --strip-components 1 -C /usr/local
photocraft
```

Maintainers: [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) explains how releases are built, signed and published.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Status:** PhotoCraft is in early alpha, and we want to be straight about where it stands: much of Photoshop's feature surface exists in some form, but **it is not yet a Photoshop replacement for daily professional work**. The biggest gaps are AI/generative features, about twenty missing tools, depth in typography and pro workflows, and plug-in compatibility. Every Photoshop menu item is wired to a command ([`docs/parity.md`](docs/parity.md)), but that measures wiring, not behaviour. The honest, dimension-by-dimension picture and where we're going next are in the [roadmap's parity assessment](docs/roadmap.md#honest-parity-assessment-2026-10-05). Expect rough edges, and please file issues (include your OS, document size, layer count and a screenshot). You can also tell us what broke on [Discord](https://discord.gg/artcraft).

## Documentation

Developer, architecture, automation, format, and security documentation is maintained in the [PhotoCraft documentation book](book/).

## Security

Security architecture, threat modeling, parser hardening, fuzzing, and vulnerability reporting are covered in the [security documentation](book/src/security/) and the repository [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Test corpora

PhotoCraft is tested against real files: our own Photoshop-authored oracle PSDs in
[photocraft-corpus](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft-corpus) plus the psd-tools, ag-psd and PngSuite sets, pinned and
sha256-verified. Fetch them with `cargo xtask corpus --all` and run the tests with
`cargo xtask test-corpus` (details in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#test-corpora)).

<h3 align="center">Come make things with us</h3>

<p align="center">
  Our Discord is where artists of every kind hang out: people who paint, shoot, draw, cut film,
  set type, and people still figuring out what they like to make. Share what you're working on,
  ask for help, tell us what's broken, or tell us what you wish these tools could do.
  Whatever your medium and however long you've been at it, you're welcome here.
