# Lightroom parity tracker

A living checklist of every Lightroom feature LightCraft aims to match, what we have, and what is missing. Agents and
humans pick work from **[Top gaps](#top-gaps)**; whoever lands a feature updates its row in the same commit.

- **Ids** come from the (local, gitignored) reference in `plan/lightroom/`: `LR-…` = feature catalog (03),
  `MENU-…` = menu items (04), `KEY-…` / `KEYC-…` = keyboard shortcuts (06, desktop / Classic), `LRC-…` = Classic
  extras (08). Ids are stable; never renumber.
- **Tier** as in the catalog: **P0** core, **P1** important parity, **P2** later / AI / niche, **OOS** out of scope.
- **Status**: ✅ done (usable end to end; polish may be noted) · 🟡 partial (note says what is missing, or the status
  is unverified) · ⬜ missing · 🚫 out of scope / not applicable.
- **Evidence**: `cmd:<id>` = command id (engine `command_specs()` or UI `UI_COMMANDS`), `ctl:<id>` = develop control
  id (`lightcraft-cli controls`), plus source files. A trailing `*` matches a prefix (`ctl:mixer.*`).
- Feature names and notes are our own words. No Adobe text, screenshots or assets belong here.

`cargo xtask parity` checks that every `cmd:`/`ctl:` id and file path below still exists (part of `cargo xtask ci`)
and prints the summary; `cargo xtask parity --write` refreshes the summary table below.

## Top gaps

Ordered by user impact, then tier, then effort. The checklist above counts features that *exist*; these are the gaps
that decide whether a photographer can switch (see the honest assessment in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md#where-we-stand)).
Take the first one nobody is working on.

1. **LR-PROF-CAMERACOLOR** (P0): our own camera colour calibration. Sony ARW, Nikon NEF and Panasonic RW2 now get a guarded file-local fit to their own embedded JPEG (colour matrix + hue/saturation/value table + tone and chroma curves, relative WB; per-model profiles pooled from many photos via `lightcraft-cli calibrate` for ARW and NEF; ARW: 7 of 10 public samples accepted, mean ΔE vs the camera JPEG 17–26 → 3–10; NEF: 13 of 13 decodable samples from 6 bodies accepted, ΔE 13–46 → 3–8, one mixed-light scene 13 → 12; RW2: 140 of 174 public samples accepted, from 93 of the 114 bodies with a preview, median ΔE 5.0); measured calibration and fidelity remain missing. Other non-DNG raws and rejected fits still use a neutral matrix. Expand validated preview fitting and use matrices the files carry themselves; never Adobe data.
2. **LR-IMP-FORMATS** (P0): **CR3** first (every Canon body since ~2018), then compressed RAF / ORF, Nikon
   "lossy after split" NEF, Canon sRAW; HEIC/AVIF decode. Clean-room, from prose descriptions only (see
   `crates/raw/src/vendor/nefc.rs` for how compressed NEF was done). Until decoded, such photos are `preview_only`.
3. **LR-IMP-CAMERA-COVERAGE** (P0): per-model verification; grow the CC0 corpus and fix per-model bugs (like the CR2
   colour-filter layout, fixed in #85 by reading the file's own tag).
4. **LR-BEHAV-RENDER-FIDELITY** (P1): a side-by-side fidelity suite against Lightroom renders (kept local in `plan/`),
   then tune tone, highlights, texture/clarity/dehaze, NR and sharpening against it.
5. **LR-EDIT-OPTICS-PROFILE** (P1): a lens-profile database of our own (embedded DNG/maker corrections work today).
6. **AI masks and Enhance** (LR-MASK-SUBJECT / SKY / PEOPLE / OBJECTS, LR-EDIT-DETAIL-DENOISE, SUPERRES, LENSBLUR):
   Object and Describe masks run SAM 3 in pure Rust (`crates/segment`); the weights (SAM License) are never bundled:
   the app offers a consented, verified download, but **LightCraft's CDN mirrors are not configured yet** (the
   built-in list is empty, so today users need their own mirror or a manual install). Subject / Sky / People could
   use the same model with fixed prompts; denoise / super-resolution models remain a maintainer decision.
7. **HDR** (Q. HDR, LR-EXP-HDR), **video** (R. Video), **Classic output modules** (Map view, Book, Slideshow module,
   Print, publish): large, well understood, lower priority than 1–5.

## Shortcuts: conflicts and missing bindings

Compared `plan/lightroom/06-shortcuts.md` (desktop part) with our bindings: command specs in `crates/engine/src/cmd/`,
`UI_COMMANDS` in `crates/ui-egui/src/menus.rs` and secondary bindings (`ALIASES`) in `crates/ui-egui/src/shortcuts.rs`.
`no_conflicting_bindings` (same file) fails when one key fires two actions.

**Fixed (M16.1):** added Lightroom-desktop keys as secondary bindings for existing commands — ⌘D Select None, ⇧E
Export dialog, Space Toggle zoom, ⇧M Create Version, ⇧X Reject + advance, ⇧U Unflag + advance. `⇧Y` fired both
Before/After Split and the History panel; History lost the binding. `W` and `⇧⌘I` also fired the engine command
under the UI command that wraps it (a no-op error); the UI command now wins.

**Deliberate differences (our key → Lightroom desktop key)** — each is a conflict with another binding we have:

| Action | Ours | Lightroom desktop | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pick flag | P | Z | Z = toggle zoom (Classic convention); P is the Classic pick key |
| Photos panel (left) | ⌘⇧L | P | P = pick |
| Expand/collapse edit sections | ⌘⌥1–5 | ⌘1–6 | ⌘0 = Zoom to Fit, ⌘1 = Zoom 100 %; Geometry lives in the Crop panel |
| Histogram | ⌘⇧H | ⌘0 | ⌘0 = Zoom to Fit |
| Square Grid | ⇧G | (none; ⇧G = Guided Upright) | Guided Upright is a button in the Crop panel |
| Export dialog | ⌘⇧E (+ ⇧E) | ⇧E | ⌘⇧E is "Edit in Photoshop" there; no external-editor command yet |
| Crop overlay cycle | ⇧O | O | O = mask overlay; ⇧O (mask colour / overlay orientation) unused otherwise |
| Create Version | ⌘⇧S (+ ⇧M) | ⇧M (Windows: Ctrl+⇧S) | — |
| Select None | ⌘⇧A (+ ⌘D) | ⌘D | — |

**Still missing / broken:**
- No command yet: F1 help, ⇧6–9 label + advance (verify the rest of the old list: full screen, settings, stacks,
  visualize spots and merges have commands now).
- `H` opens Remove; Lightroom also uses it (Classic) to hide pins — pins toggle from View → Show Mask Pins.
- ⌘M / ⌘H / ⌘Q / ⌘W rely on the platform window defaults (unverified).

<!-- Sections below hold one row per id. Keep the column order: Id | Feature | Tier | Status | Evidence | Notes. -->

## A. Import (IMP)

| Id | Feature | Tier | Status | Evidence | Missing / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LR-IMP-ADD-DIALOG | Add photos/folders | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:file.addPhotos`, `cmd:library.importPreview`, `cmd:library.import` (`mode`, `album`, `albumName`, `preset`, `keywords`), `crates/ui-egui/src/import.rs` | review dialog (Import Photos): the scanned source (a scanned folder is not added to Local), candidate grid with thumbnails and checkboxes (duplicates by path/content marked and unchecked), transfer mode (add in place / copy / move, each explained), album (existing/new), preset, keywords; the folder scan runs on a background thread with a progress window and Cancel (a NAS folder no longer freezes the window); the import itself (probing, sidecars, copying / moving files) runs on a worker thread and its batches join the library between frames, with a progress window and Cancel; one undo step. Drag-and-drop goes through the same background import |
| LR-IMP-DRAGDROP | Drop files/folders to import | P0 | ✅ | `crates/ui-egui/src/lib.rs` (dropped files → `cmd:library.import`) | dropping onto a specific album not supported |
| LR-IMP-DUPES | Skip duplicates by content | P1 | ✅ | `crates/engine/src/import.rs`, `crates/engine/src/tests_import.rs` | |
| LR-IMP-DEVICE | Import from camera/card | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.devices`, `cmd:file.addFromDevice`, `crates/engine/src/devices.rs` | mounted volumes with a DCIM folder (macOS /Volumes, Linux /media and /run/media, Windows drive letters); File → Import from Device → the import review, copying into the library by default; menus serve the last scan and rescan in the background (never blocking a frame; hot-plugs repaint); copies are verified (a new file, synced, checked against the content hash the scan computed — byte compare with the source when there is none, issue #134; a bad copy is removed and reported as failed, never counted as imported; taken names get -1, -2…, never replaced — issue #96, `crates/engine/src/import_move.rs`); no PTP/MTP (cameras that don't mount as a disk) |
| LR-IMP-AUTO | Watched-folder auto import | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:library.autoImport`, `cmd:library.autoImportScan`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/settings.rs` | Settings ▸ Import ▸ Auto Import: a watched folder whose new photos are added (in place or copied) once complete, into an optional album; scanned every 3 s |
| LR-IMP-PRESET | Preset on import | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:library.import` (`preset`) | chosen in the import review; one History entry |
| LR-IMP-RAWDEFAULT | Raw defaults | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.preferences`, `crates/engine/src/import.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/settings.rs` | LightCraft default / a preset / per camera (make + model); non-raw default too; the preset look counts as unedited and Reset returns to it |
| LR-IMP-MIGRATE | Migrate other catalogs | OOS | 🚫 | | |
| LR-IMP-PROFILES | Import profiles & presets | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:file.importPresets`, `cmd:preset.import`, `cmd:profile.import`, `crates/engine/src/preset_import.rs`, `crates/engine/src/preset_luminar.rs` | presets: .lcpreset, XMP, classic .lrtemplate, photos carrying edits ("DNG presets"), Luminar looks (.lmp, .mplumpack collections; sliders with a counterpart), .zip bundles, folders (folder → group), drag & drop; masks carried over; unmapped settings reported; profiles: .cube 3D LUTs; Adobe profile formats deliberately unsupported |
| LR-IMP-LOCAL | Work on files in place | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:library.browse`, `cmd:photo.addToLibrary`, `cmd:library.import` (mode add), `cmd:local.addRoot`, `cmd:local.hide`, `cmd:local.restoreHidden`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/browse.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/left.rs` (`local_section`), `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/grid.rs` (`folder_header`) | Local: browse Pictures / Desktop / Downloads / Home or any folder without adding it (breadcrumb, Include subfolders, Add N to My Photos); browsed photos stay out of All Photos, albums and counts; folders picked with Browse Folder… (or Keep in Local / Add to Local on a folder row) stay listed across restarts, and browsing a folder inside a listed one highlights it inside that tree (opened down to it, siblings reachable) instead of adding a root; edits go to XMP sidecars; importing promotes them; right-click a top-level location → Remove from Local hides the shortcut only (nothing on disk or in the catalog changes), saved with the UI state, and “Show N hidden locations” (or Browse Folder… on it) brings it back; a folder is one location however its path is spelled (`/` or `\`, trailing separator, `.`/`..`, drive-letter case; `folder_key` in `crates/catalog/src/query.rs`); browsed photos nobody changed are forgotten once their folder has not been browsed for 30 days (Settings → Performance → Local folders, 0 = never; checked when the library opens, or `cmd:library.forgetLocal` with `dryRun`; files and sidecars stay, browsing again brings them back; see `crates/catalog/src/local.rs` for what counts as a change) |
| LR-IMP-SIDECAR-SPLIT | Separate XMP sidecar variants | P2 | ⬜ | `cmd:library.xmpPreferences` | sidecar naming option exists (stem/full), no split sidecars |
| LR-IMP-FORMATS | Supported formats | P0 | 🟡 | `crates/codecs/src/lib.rs`, `crates/raw/src/lib.rs` | JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, JXL, PSD, GIF, BMP; DNG (incl. lossy / Smart Preview DNG), CR2 (colour-filter layout from the file's `CR2CFAPattern` tag, issue #85), ARW (pre-2017 bodies: white balance and black level from enciphered maker-note / `SR2SubIFD` data, issue #148; downsized Sony lossless YCbCr 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 tiles decoded to linear RGB, verified on private ILCE-7M4 3:2 & 4:3 examples including 16-bit full-resolution export), NEF (uncompressed, lossless and lossy compressed 12/14-bit, `crates/raw/src/vendor/nefc.rs`), RAF, RW2 / Leica RWL / Panasonic RAW in every raw format (compressed 4 and 6, the prefix-coded strips of format 8 from the GH6 on, packed 2/5/7, the 16-bit words of the 2005–2007 bodies; black levels, in-camera aspect crops and mapped-out defect pixels; 178 CC0 files from 118 bodies checked, `crates/raw/src/vendor/rw2.rs`), PEF, ORF. 12-bit NEF black level: maker note `0x003d` is in 14-bit units (D750, D780, D850, D7500, Z 50 checked). CR3 opens from its full-size embedded JPEG with full metadata (Exif, GPS, XMP from the `CMT1`/`CMT2`/`CMT4` boxes, `crates/meta/src/cr3.rs`) but its raw data is not decoded yet. Missing: CR3 raw decoding (CRX), compressed RAF/ORF, NEFs labelled compressed (34713) but stored uncompressed without a `0x0096` table (Z 6 packed 14-bit, D850 12-bit uncompressed), NEF "lossy after split" (preview only: imported with `preview_only` = the decoder's reason, rendered as a rendered JPEG, flagged by a grid badge and loupe/Edit/Info notices, `previewOnly` in `catalog.query`; Reload clears it once the file decodes), HEIC/AVIF decode |
| LR-IMP-CAMERA-COVERAGE | Camera coverage, verified per model | P0 | 🟡 | `crates/raw/tests/corpus.rs`, `xtask/src/main.rs` | a supported container is not the same as every camera that writes it decoding correctly: ~55 CC0 corpus files (plus ~60 NEFs checked by hand and 178 Panasonic / Leica RW2, RWL and RAW files from 118 bodies, checked against each file's own JPEG) against the >1,000 models Lightroom lists; per-model differences still surface (e.g. the CR2 colour-filter layout differed by model until it was read from the file's own tag, issue #85, checked on 35 CR2 bodies; pre-2017 Sony ARWs opened green until their scrambled white balance / black level were read, issue #148, checked on 16 ARWs from 15 Sony bodies). Grow the CC0 corpus per model and test each sample decodes with plausible colour |
| LR-IMP-CULL-AT-IMPORT | Culling analysis at import | P2 | 🟡 | `cmd:photo.analyze` | run Assisted Culling on the imported photos (they're selected after an import); not automatic |
| LR-IMP-MOVE | Move on import [Classic] | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.import` (`mode` move), `crates/engine/src/import_move.rs`, `crates/engine/src/tests_import_move.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/import.rs` | Transfer ▸ Move with Copy's destination, folders (day / month / one folder / custom template), rename template and example destination; XMP sidecars (both namings) move along; each source is removed only after its destination is written (hard link on the same volume, else copied, synced and compared byte for byte) and its catalog record is saved; failed, duplicate, unchecked files keep their sources, taken names get -1, -2…, never overwritten; files already in the destination/library are added in place; sources that can't be removed (read-only card) are kept and reported (`kept`). Undo removes the photos from the library but leaves the moved files at the destination. No Copy as DNG while moving |
| LR-IMP-DNG-CONVERT | Convert to DNG on import [Classic] | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:library.import` (`dng`), `crates/ui-egui/src/import.rs` | copy imports: Raw files ▸ Copy as DNG (lossless; the card is untouched); the raw copy is removed only once its DNG is verified and on disk (issue #106) |

## B. Library management (LIB)

| Id | Feature | Tier | Status | Evidence | Missing / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LR-LIB-ALLPHOTOS | All photos | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:library.source`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/left.rs` | |
| LR-LIB-RECENT-ADDED | Recently added | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.source` (`recentlyAdded`), `crates/engine/src/view.rs` (`RECENT_DAYS`) | photos imported in the 30 days up to the latest import, newest import first, grouped by import day |
| LR-LIB-BYDATE | Browse by date | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.filter` (`date`), `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/left.rs` (`date_row`), `crates/catalog/src/query.rs` (`date_groups`) | year → month → day tree with library-wide counts; a row filters the current source by that date. Active filters show as removable chips under the grid header (`crates/ui-egui/src/panels/chips.rs`, with “+N more” and Clear all), the header counts “N of M photos” (matching of the source's total), a badge on the top-bar filter icon counts them, and an empty result says no photos match the active filters |
| LR-LIB-ALBUM | Albums | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:album.create`, `cmd:album.rename`, `cmd:album.delete`, `cmd:album.addPhotos`, `cmd:album.removePhotos`, `cmd:dialog.newAlbum` | no drag photos onto album (LR-BEHAV-DRAGDROP), no album sort |
| LR-LIB-FOLDER | Folders of albums | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:album.create` (`folder`), `cmd:album.move` | moving is command-only (no drag, no "Move to" menu) |
| LR-LIB-SMARTALBUM | Smart albums | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:album.createSmart`, `cmd:album.setRules`, `crates/catalog/src/query.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/filterbar.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/lib.rs` (`album_counts`) | saved filters (rating/flag/label/kind/edited/keyword/camera/lens/date range/text/album), live; match-all only (no any/none rule groups, no rule editor dialog — rules come from the filter bar or `album.setRules`); sidebar counts are cached per catalog revision (and per minute while an “in the last…” rule is used), counted without building id lists |
| LR-LIB-SHARED-ALBUM | Shared albums | P2 | ⬜ | | needs a sharing service |
| LR-LIB-OFFLINE | Keep album offline | P2 | 🚫 | | not applicable: local-first library |
| LR-LIB-TARGET | Target album | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:album.setTarget`, `cmd:album.toggleTarget` | see LRC-LIB-COLLECTIONS |
| LR-LIB-RATING | Star ratings | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.rate` (`advance`), `crates/ui-egui/src/shortcuts.rs` | |
| LR-LIB-FLAG | Pick / reject flags | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.pick`, `cmd:photo.reject`, `cmd:photo.unflag`, `cmd:photo.flag` | pick key is P (see Shortcuts); no flag cycle |
| LR-LIB-LABEL | Colour labels | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.label`, `cmd:label.setNames`, `cmd:label.names`, `cmd:dialog.labelNames`, keys 6–9 in `crates/ui-egui/src/shortcuts.rs` | Photo menu and grid context menu (coloured, named), Info-panel swatches, label dot in grid cells; editable label names (undoable, journaled); no purple key (as in Lightroom), no custom extra labels |
| LR-LIB-KEYWORD | Keywords | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:panel.keywords`, `cmd:photo.setMeta` (`addKeywords`/`removeKeywords`), `cmd:keyword.list`, `cmd:keyword.rename`, `cmd:keyword.delete`, `cmd:keyword.merge`, `cmd:keyword.suggest`, `crates/catalog/src/keywords.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/left.rs` | left-panel keyword tree with counts (click filters, children included; context menu rename / merge / delete / add / remove); library-wide ops are one undo step and replay from the op log; suggestions (co-occurring / most used / completions) in the Keywords panel; no keyword drag-and-drop |
| LR-LIB-PEOPLE | People / faces | P2 | 🟡 | `cmd:view.people`, `cmd:view.faceBoxes`, `cmd:photo.removeRegion`, `cmd:photo.setRegion`, `cmd:library.filter`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/people.rs`, `crates/catalog/src/query.rs` (`people`), `crates/engine/src/media.rs` (`face_job`), `crates/meta/src/xmp.rs` | MVP: named face regions read from XMP (MWG-RS, read-only, see `docs/xmp-interop.md`; clipped to the photo; Lightroom's `Rotation` of ±π/2 and π handled, mirrored orientations taken as written; boxes follow Rotate Left/Right and flips; a sidecar stating `mwg-rs:Regions`, even empty, replaces the photo's on re-read, one without leaves them) become cards in the People view (View ▸ People, or the People button in the toolbar): a close-up of the person's largest face, name and photo count; a click filters the grid (`person` in `library.filter`, `person:` search token, filter chip). Face boxes in the loupe can be switched off (View ▸ Face Boxes, toolbar) resized with eight drag handles and removed with the × shown on hover (catalog-only and undoable, one undo step per drag; the sidecar is never rewritten for either); no moving a box by dragging it yet. No face detection, no unnamed people / suggestions, no manual tagging, no writing regions back |
| LR-LIB-STACK | Stacks | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:stack.group`, `cmd:stack.ungroup`, `cmd:stack.toggle`, `cmd:stack.setTop`, `cmd:stack.remove`, `cmd:stack.auto`, `crates/catalog/src/stacks.rs` | grid/filmstrip count badges, expand/collapse, auto-stack by capture time; no visual-similarity auto-stack |
| LR-LIB-VERSIONS | Versions | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:version.create` | see section M |
| LR-LIB-DELETE | Delete / Recently Deleted | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.delete`, `cmd:photo.restore`, `cmd:photo.deletePermanently` | Restore and Delete Permanently in the Photo menu and the photo context menus for photos in Recently Deleted (before, the UI had no way to restore); adding a file that is in Recently Deleted again selects it there (side panel opened) and says how to restore it or import it afresh; no confirmation dialog, no auto-purge after N days, no "Empty" |
| LR-LIB-REMOVE-ALBUM | Remove from album | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:album.removePhotos` | |
| LR-LIB-DUPLICATE | Duplicate a photo | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.duplicate` | Photo ▸ Duplicate: a real `-copy` file with the same settings, metadata and albums (virtual copies share the file) |
| LR-LIB-RENAME | Batch rename | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.rename`, `cmd:photo.renamePreview`, `cmd:photo.renameTokens`, `cmd:dialog.rename`, `crates/engine/src/rename.rs` (`TOKENS`) | template tokens {name} {num} {seq:N} {date:%Y%m%d} {folder} {camera} {lens} {iso} {rating} {title} {creator} {ext} (shared with export naming and import rename); a Tags picker beside every template field (Rename Photos, import Rename, export File name) lists each tag with meaning + live example, the date directives and the rules, and inserts the clicked tag at the text cursor; unknown tags are flagged; preview; renames files on disk with their XMP sidecars (a stem sidecar another file still shares, e.g. raw + JPEG, is copied rather than taken), never overwriting (-1, -2… suffixes; a change of letter case only is checked by file identity, so on case-sensitive volumes `img_1.jpg` next to `IMG_1.JPG` is a collision), rolls back on failure (a file that can't be moved back is reported old → new and the library follows it as an undoable partial rename; the same for undo/redo); undo/redo move the files; virtual copies follow |
| LR-LIB-CAPTURETIME | Edit capture time | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.setCaptureTime`, `cmd:dialog.captureTime`, `crates/catalog/src/dates.rs` | set (the other selected photos shift by the same amount, or `each`), shift by days/hours/minutes, time-zone shift; one undo step, journaled; Info panel button; no “revert to original capture time” |
| LR-LIB-SHOWFINDER | Reveal original in file manager | P0 | ✅ | `cmd:app.showInFinder` | ⌘R (see MENU-FILE-SHOWFINDER) |
| LR-LIB-COVER | Album cover | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:album.setCover` | |

| LR-PROF-CAMERACOLOR | Camera colour calibration (own) | P0 | 🟡 | `crates/raw/src/color.rs`, `crates/raw/src/profile.rs`, `crates/engine/src/camera_preview.rs` | DNG files use the colour matrices and the camera-profile look they carry (`ProfileHueSatMap`, `ProfileLookTable`, `ProfileToneCurve`, read from the file at run time per DNG spec ch. 6 — Lightroom-converted DNGs rendered flat and muted without them, issue #138); Sony ARW, Nikon NEF and Panasonic RW2 get a guarded file-local fit to their own embedded JPEG — chromaticity matrix + hue/saturation/value table + tone and chroma curves, relative WB — or, with a local per-model profile pooled from many photos (`lightcraft-cli calibrate`, ARW and NEF so far, `crates/engine/src/camera_profiles.rs`), the profile's colour and only their own tone/chroma curves (on 29 held-out ILCE-7M4 photos mean ΔE vs the camera JPEG 3.54 → 3.10), kept with smart previews (see docs/camera-preview-colour.md); ARW: on 10 public raw.pixls.us samples from 8 bodies 7 fits were accepted, mean ΔE vs the camera JPEG 17–26 → 3–10; NEF: 13 of 13 decodable samples (D750, D780, D850, D7500, Z 50 and local D7500 shots) accepted, ΔE 13–46 → 3–8 (issue #150); RW2 / RWL: 140 of 174 public samples accepted, from 93 of the 114 bodies with a preview, median ΔE 5.0 with matching lightness (13 of the 14 corpus files with a preview: ΔE 9.6–27 → 2.8–8.9; most rejections are compacts and kit zooms whose camera JPEG is distortion-corrected); this is not measured camera calibration; other raws and rejected fits use a neutral fallback (camera RGB ≈ linear sRGB, `matrix_is_fallback`) with as-shot white balance, so colours are muted and not accurate. Needs our own per-camera calibration: matrices the files carry themselves (e.g. Olympus `ColorMatrix`), fitting each camera to its own embedded JPEG, then chart shots. Adobe matrices / DCPs are never used. Biggest image-quality gap today |
| LR-PROF-CREATIVE | Creative profiles (own) | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:develop.profile`, `crates/pipeline/src/profiles.rs` | 16 own looks in Film / Cinematic / Muted / B&W (tone + point-curve fades, colour grading, mixer / B&W mix); scale with `ctl:profile.amount`; sliders untouched |

The model runs on its own worker thread (the UI never waits; panics become errors), is unloaded after 10 min idle, and is optional: the segmentation is stored with the mask (288² logits), so renders and exports never need it. Weights are never bundled (SAM License): without them the app offers a consented background download (mirrors, resume, timeouts, SHA-256) — **but no default download location is configured yet** (users set `LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_MIRRORS` or install by hand; see docs/ai-masks.md). Not verified against Lightroom's Select Object; no brush/box object mode; the first click on a photo waits for its analysis (~4 s on an M4 Pro, much longer on CPU) |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LR-BEHAV-AUTOSAVE | Instant autosave | P0 | ✅ | `crates/catalog/src/journal.rs`, `crates/engine/src/library.rs` | every change fsynced before the command returns; a failed write fails the command ("saved in memory but not written to disk"), keeps the change queued and retries; top-bar warning until saved; a write that fails part-way is cut back to the last whole record so the retry never reads back as damage (logs from older builds with such a fragment load in full); quitting saves queued changes in the closing snapshot even when the log can't be appended to; versioned catalog format (`journal::VERSION`): older libraries are upgraded on open, a library from a newer LightCraft is refused untouched ("written by a newer version") |

| LR-BEHAV-BG-TASKS | Background tasks | P0 | ✅ | `crates/preview/src/lib.rs` (`JobPool`), `crates/ui-egui/src/export_task.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/import.rs` | renders off the UI thread; exports started from the UI run on a worker thread with a progress panel and Cancel (`ui.inspect` → `export`); imports show a progress window. No combined activity centre |
| LR-BEHAV-OFFLINE | Offline editing | P1 | ✅ | | local-first: everything works offline |
| LR-BEHAV-WEB-SAFETY | Library safety in the browser build | P1 | 🟡 | `cmd:file.backupLibrary`, `cmd:file.restoreLibrary`, `apps/lightcraft-web/src/safety.rs`, `apps/lightcraft-web/src/backup.rs`, `apps/lightcraft-web/src/files.rs` | web only (experimental): Back Up Library (zip of the catalog and every stored original) and a non-destructive Restore; failed saves show as unsaved and are retried; a photo that can't be stored isn't added; one tab per library (Web Locks); notices for storage that isn't persistent and for a library that can't open; `?reset` asks first; a panic shows a message. Missing: `?safe` start, deleting originals of removed photos, zip64 (backups > 4 GB) |
| LR-BEHAV-GPU | GPU acceleration | P0 | ✅ | `crates/gpu/src/render.rs`, `cmd:app.gpu`, `docs/gpu-pipeline.md` | CPU fallback per render on device limits, out of memory, device errors / loss, incomplete or black results (`perf.gpuReason`, `perf.gpuFallback`); short submissions for slow iGPUs; backend choice (DX12 only on Windows, `LIGHTCRAFT_GPU_BACKEND` / `WGPU_BACKEND`), device created after the window opens, crash sentinel (issue #136); no tiling beyond the buffer limit (CPU) |
| LR-BEHAV-RENDER-FIDELITY | Rendering matches Lightroom | P1 | 🟡 | `crates/pipeline/src/lib.rs`, `crates/pipeline/src/tone.rs` | every slider exists and works, but the character of the result (tone curve shape, highlight recovery, texture / clarity / dehaze, noise reduction, sharpening, default look) is tuned by eye; there is no systematic side-by-side comparison against Lightroom on the same CC0 raws. Needs a fidelity suite: Lightroom reference renders kept only in the local `plan/` (never committed), compared per slider and preset with a perceptual metric |
| LR-BEHAV-DRAGDROP | Drag and drop | P1 | ✅ | `crates/ui-egui/src/lib.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/grid.rs` (`drag_feedback`), `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/left.rs` (`drop_target`) | files → app (import); grid photos → an album row (adds the selection, with a count badge while dragging) |

UI-only (no command), like the By Date / Keywords disclosure triangles; photos dropped on a folded Albums section have no target |
| LR-BEHAV-PANEL-RESIZE | Resizable side panels | P1 | ✅ | `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/mod.rs` (`resizable_side`), `crates/ui-egui/src/state.rs` (`LEFT_WIDTH`, `RIGHT_WIDTH`), `crates/ui-egui/src/tests_panels.rs` | drag the left sidebar's right edge (200–480 pt) or the right panel's left edge (250–520 pt); the photo area keeps ≥ 360 pt; widths are kept across panels, views and restarts (`leftWidth` / `rightWidth` in the UI state); the Presets column stays fixed |

| LR-BEHAV-LOCALE | Language options | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:app.language.english`, `cmd:app.language.simplifiedChinese`, `cmd:app.language.traditionalChinese`, `cmd:app.language.japanese`, `cmd:app.language.portuguese` | Edit > Language lists every language in the table and the active one is checked; shared with Settings > General (docs/localization.md) |
| LR-BEHAV-LOCALIZE | Localisation | P2 | 🟡 | `crates/ui-egui/src/i18n.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/locales/`, `docs/localization.md`, `docs/localization-zh-hans.md`, `docs/localization-zh-hant.md`, `docs/localization-ja.md`, `docs/localization-pt-br.md` | One table entry per language (code, endonym, ISO 15924 script, catalog): English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese UI with a persisted language preference and craft-fonts regular/bold faces per script; menus, edit, crop/masks, settings, import/export and primary progress messages. Adding a language is a table entry plus two catalogs. Stock presets/profiles, history steps, library headings, date headings and capture times are localised (user-named items stay verbatim); the Traditional Chinese catalog is the most complete, the others fall back to English for messages they lack. Technical errors/release notes remain English; Traditional Chinese borrows the Simplified Chinese face (no TC face in craft-fonts yet), and the web build embeds only the Japanese face. |

A library that can't be opened at launch (locked, unreadable, newer format, drive missing) shows a window — Try Again, Choose Another Library…, Continue Without Saving (then a banner; nothing written), Quit — instead of a silent demo session (`crates/ui-egui/src/panels/library_problem.rs`) |
| LRC-LIB-FOLDERS | Disk folder tree | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.browse`, `cmd:folder.rename`, `cmd:folder.move`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/left.rs` (`local_section`, `folder_tree`) | standard places + the browsed folder + Browse Folder…, each an expandable tree of subfolders, breadcrumb navigation; context menu: Rename Folder…, Move Folder To…, Show in Finder (on disk, photos relinked; one undo step each: undo / redo move the folder back and forth, refused when the destination is taken) |
| LRC-LIB-COLLECTIONS | Collections & sets | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:album.create`, `cmd:album.createSmart`, `cmd:album.toggleTarget`, `cmd:album.setTarget`, `cmd:album.clearQuick` | albums + folders (sets), smart albums (rule editor; rules incl. File Path — the whole string, either separator, case-insensitive), Quick Collection and target album (B in the grids adds / removes the selection; album menu ▸ Set as Target Album; the target is marked +) |
| LRC-LIB-SMARTCOLL | Smart-collection rules | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:album.createSmart`, `cmd:album.setRules`, `cmd:album.ruleFields`, `cmd:dialog.smartAlbum`, `crates/catalog/src/rules.rs`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/rules_editor.rs` | rule editor: match all / any / none, nested groups (⌥+ or + Group), 30 fields (rating, flag, label, type, edits, keywords, any text, filename, file path, format, title, caption, camera, lens, location, creator, copyright, copyright status, capture / import / edit date, ISO, aperture, focal length, megapixels, GPS, virtual copy, album) with text / number / date / in-the-last operators; live match count; also usable as a library filter (`ruleSet`) |
| LRC-LIB-PUBLISH | Publish services | P2 | ⬜ | | |
| LRC-LIB-FILTERBAR | Library filter bar | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:view.filterBar`, `cmd:filter.applyPreset`, `cmd:library.filter` (`labels`, `ruleSet`), `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/filterbar.rs` | rating/flag/label (several labels at once = any of them)/kind/edited/camera/lens/keyword, clear, save as smart album, filter presets; the filter stays as you change albums (always locked, as in the desktop app); arbitrary conditions via the smart-album rule editor |
| LRC-LIB-STACKS | Stacks (full) | P1 | ✅ | `crates/catalog/src/stacks.rs`, `cmd:stack.group`, `cmd:stack.split`, `cmd:stack.moveUp`, `cmd:stack.moveDown` | group / ungroup / toggle / set top / remove / auto by time / split / move up and down |
| LRC-LIB-VC | Virtual copies | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.virtualCopy` | ⌘' |
| LRC-LIB-LABELS | Colour-label sets | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:label.sets`, `cmd:label.applySet`, `cmd:label.saveSet`, `cmd:label.deleteSet`, `cmd:label.setNames`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/manage.rs` | built-in Colors / Review sets + user sets (Photo ▸ Set Color Label, Edit Label Names… dialog); names written to and read from `xmp:Label` |
| LRC-LIB-KEYWORDS | Hierarchical keywords, sets, painter | P1 | ✅ | `crates/catalog/src/keywords.rs`, `cmd:keyword.list`, `cmd:keyword.sets`, `cmd:keyword.toggleFromSet`, `cmd:keyword.saveSet`, `cmd:tool.keywordPainter` | hierarchical `a\|b\|c` keywords (tree, parent filters include children, rename moves children); keyword sets + Recent Keywords (⌥1–⌥9); keyword painter (Keywords panel ▸ Paint: click photos in the grid to toggle a keyword, Esc stops) |
| LRC-LIB-METADATA | Metadata panel & presets | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.setMeta`, `cmd:metadata.savePreset`, `cmd:metadata.applyPreset`, `cmd:metadata.presets`, `cmd:metadata.deletePreset`, `cmd:dialog.captureTime` | IPTC core, accessibility, place, capture-time edit; copyright status (unknown / copyrighted / public domain), rights usage terms and copyright info URL (`photo.setMeta` `copyrightStatus`, `usageTerms`, `copyrightUrl`; XMP Rights Management fields, kept by "copyright only" exports, a smart-album rule); metadata presets (Photo → Metadata Preset, Save Metadata Preset… from the active photo; applied on import from Settings) |
| LRC-LIB-QUICKDEV | Quick develop | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:develop.quickAdjust`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/edit.rs` (`quick_develop`) | grid with several photos selected: Edit panel ▸ Quick Develop steps (exposure ⅓ / 1 stop, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks, clarity, vibrance, temperature) added to each photo's own value, one undo step |
| LRC-LIB-PEOPLE | People view | P2 | 🟡 | `cmd:view.people`, `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/people.rs` | Named People cards (face close-up, name, photos) for the photos the active filters let through, with the filter chips shown above them; no Unnamed People, no per-person page, no confirm / reject |
| LRC-LIB-COMMENTS | Comments panel | P2 | ⬜ | | |
| LRC-LIB-VISUALSEARCH | Find similar photos | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:library.findSimilar`, `crates/pipeline/src/cull.rs` (`signature`) | photo menu / Photo ▸ Find Similar Photos: look-alike photos (composition and tones), most similar first, as a filter (`only`) |
| LRC-LIB-MISSING | Missing files & relink | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.missing`, `cmd:photo.relink`, `cmd:library.findMissing`, `cmd:file.findMissing`, `cmd:photo.locate`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/missing.rs` (`checked_path`) | File → Find Missing Photos… (anywhere in a folder: same name, size and content hash; renamed files by size + content hash; same name and size alone only when unambiguous — look-alikes are skipped and reported; searched on a worker thread, one undo step), photo menu → Locate Missing File…; unreadable files show "!" in the grid and a reason in the loupe; undo never moves files. Missing Photos in the sidebar (counted on a worker thread; the view, the Info panel, the grid's context menu and thumbnails read file availability from a cache a worker thread fills, so an offline NAS never stalls a frame); it covers library photos only — Local browse records are never checked, for the count, the view, `library.missing` and Find Missing alike |
| LRC-LIB-CONVERT | Convert to DNG | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.convertToDng`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/convert.rs` | Photo ▸ Convert to DNG: lossless DNG next to the raw with the settings embedded, photo (and its virtual copies) relinked; originals kept; undoable; the DNG is decoded and compared with the raw data, written to a temp file, synced, read back and only then given a free name (never replacing a file) — a failed write leaves no DNG and the photo on its raw (issue #106) |
| LRC-LIB-PREVIEWS | Build / discard previews | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.buildPreviews`, `cmd:library.previewProgress`, `cmd:library.cancelPreviews`, `cmd:library.clearPreviews`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/previews.rs`, `crates/preview/src/lib.rs` | File ▸ Previews: build standard-sized (Settings → Performance size) or 1:1 previews of the selected / visible photos in the background (progress toasts, stop), discard the cache; disk thumbnail + view cache; no smart previews (offline proxies) |
| LRC-LIB-SLIDESHOW-IMPROMPTU | Impromptu slideshow | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:view.slideshow` | see LR-VIEW-SLIDESHOW |
| LRC-DEV-SNAPSHOTS | Named snapshots | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:version.create`, `cmd:version.restore` | = versions |
| LRC-DEV-HISTORY | Full history panel | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:history.list`, `cmd:history.restore`, `cmd:history.clear` | row menu: copy step to before, create version from step, clear history |
| LRC-DEV-SOFTPROOF | Soft proofing | P2 | 🟡 | `cmd:view.softProof`, `crates/pipeline/src/output.rs` (`Proof`), `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/edit.rs` (`soft_proofing`) | S in the loupe (in grids S stays Expand/Collapse Stack): paper-white surround and "Proof Preview", proof profile (sRGB / Display P3 / Adobe RGB / ProPhoto / Rec. 2020), destination (red) and display (blue) gamut warnings, Create Proof Copy (a named virtual copy). Missing: printer ICC profiles, rendering intent, Simulate Paper & Ink |
| LRC-DEV-AUTOSYNC | Sync / auto sync / paste previous | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:develop.sync`, `cmd:develop.autoSync`, `cmd:develop.pastePrevious` | Edit ▸ Sync Settings / Auto Sync (⌥⇧⌘A): only the changed settings carry over, one undo step, slider drags sync on release, spots / red eye stay per photo; Edit panel banner |
| LRC-DEV-MATCHEXP | Match total exposures | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:develop.matchExposure` | Photo ▸ Match Total Exposures: the selected photos' Exposure set so shutter × ISO ÷ aperture² plus the slider matches the active photo's |
| LRC-DEV-CALIB | Calibration panel | P1 | ✅ | `ctl:calibration.*` | |
| LRC-DEV-TAT | Targeted adjustment tools | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:develop.targeted` (`target`: curve / hue / sat / lum) | |
| LRC-DEV-DEFAULTS | Per-camera raw defaults | P1 | ✅ | `cmd:library.preferences` (`camera`, `import.perCamera`), `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/settings.rs` | Settings → Import: raw default and per-camera presets |

| LRC-MAP-TRACKLOG | GPS track logs | P2 | ✅ | `cmd:photo.autoTagTracklog`, `cmd:photo.tagFromTracklog`, `crates/meta/src/gpx.rs` | Photo ▸ Auto-Tag from Tracklog…: a GPX 1.0 / 1.1 track log sets the GPS of the selected photos by capture time — interpolated between the points of a track segment, else the nearest point within `maxGap` (10 min); never across segment breaks. The camera's time zone comes from the photo (Exif offset) or is asked for; photos that already have a location keep it unless `replace`; `dryRun` previews; one undo step. No track drawn on a map (no Map module) |

### Japanese text watermarks

`app.export` watermark objects accept `vertical` (boolean, defaults to false). The export
dialog offers Horizontal/Vertical and multiline text. Japanese glyphs fall back to the craft-fonts
Mincho faces (BIZ UDMincho; on the web build, BIZ UDPGothic) when built with `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`. Vertical lettering uses upright em cells and right-to-left newline columns;
Latin stays upright. Advanced Japanese composition remains open. Regression coverage:
`export::tests::japanese_watermarks_support_vertical_columns`, `japanese_watermark_options_and_legacy_defaults`, `watermarks_work_without_craft_fonts`.
