## Edit like you mean it

LightCraft is a complete darkroom in a single native app. Every adjustment is **non-destructive**, so your originals
are never touched. Every slider renders through a **scene-referred, wide-gamut, 32-bit float pipeline**: highlights
roll off like film, shadows open up without halos, and colour stays clean from capture to export.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ☀️ Light
**Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks**, with edge-aware local tone mapping (a guided filter on
log-luminance). Pulling −100 Highlights recovers a blown sky without the grey halos you'd get from a naive curve.

### 🎨 Color
**White balance** by temperature and tint (Kelvin for raw, relative for JPEG) with presets, Auto and a
click-to-neutralise **eyedropper**. **Vibrance** that protects skin tones, **Saturation**, an 8-band **Color Mixer**
(hue / saturation / luminance) and 3-way **Color Grading** wheels with blending and balance. All of it is computed in
OkLCh, a modern perceptual colour space.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ✨ Effects
**Texture** for fine detail, **Clarity** for mid-tone punch, **Dehaze** (dark-channel prior with guided refinement;
push it negative to add atmosphere), post-crop **Vignette** with highlight priority, roundness and feather, and
resolution-independent film **Grain** with size and roughness.

### 📈 Tone Curve
Parametric region curve with movable splits **plus** point curves for RGB, Red, Green and Blue. Curves are monotone by
construction, so you never get an accidental tone inversion.

## Color grading, the cinematic way

Split-tone shadows, midtones and highlights independently with drag-anywhere colour wheels. Below, Dorothea Lange's
*Migrant Mother* gets a warm, print-like tone (highlights at 42°, shadows at 28°) in two drags.

## Masking that goes where you point

Paint with a **Brush** (size, feather, flow, density, erase), drop **Linear** and **Radial Gradients** with draggable
pins, or select by **Luminance Range**, **Color Range**, **Sky**, **Subject** and **Background**. Combine components
with **Add / Subtract / Intersect**, invert any of them, and dial in 15 local adjustments per mask (Temp, Tint,
Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, Texture, Clarity, Dehaze, Hue, Saturation, Sharpness, Noise)
plus an overall Amount.

</p>

<br>

## Presets, profiles & the Color Mixer

Eighteen hand-built presets ship in the box (*Golden Hour, Teal & Orange, Faded Matte, Selenium Tone, Crisp
Landscape* and more), each with an **Amount** slider from 0 to 200 %. Save your own from any group of settings, mark
favourites, and copy, paste or sync edits across a whole selection with exactly the groups you choose.

## Organize everything

A library that stays out of your way: **All Photos**, **Recently Added**, **Picks**, **By Date**, **Albums** nested in
**Folders**, and **Recently Deleted**. Rate with <kbd>0</kbd>–<kbd>5</kbd>, flag with <kbd>P</kbd> / <kbd>X</kbd> /
<kbd>U</kbd>, colour-label with <kbd>6</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd>. Search understands fields:
`rating:>3 flag:pick iso:>800 camera:x2 date:2026-04 keyword:mountains`. Every view sorts by capture date,
import date, edit date, name, rating, size or at random (a stable shuffle; View → Sort → Reshuffle for a new one). The justified **Photo Grid** and **Square Grid** views are virtualized,
so they stay smooth whether you have forty photos or forty thousand.

</tr>
</table>

<br>

## Built for agents

Every menu item, slider, brush stroke, crop handle and keystroke in LightCraft is a **command** with a stable id and
JSON parameters. The UI, the keyboard, the CLI, a JSON-lines control channel and an **MCP server** all dispatch
through the same entry point. An agent can cull a shoot, develop it, mask a sky and export it, and *see* the result.

```sh
lightcraft --control 7980 ~/Pictures/trip
```
```jsonc
{"method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "photo.flag",  "params": {"flag": "pick"}}}
{"method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "develop.set", "params": {"values": {"light.highlights": -45, "light.shadows": 38}}}}
{"method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "mask.add",    "params": {"kind": "radial", "center": [0.62, 0.4], "rx": 0.2, "ry": 0.14}}}
{"method": "ui.clickWidget",   "params": {"id": "slider:effects.clarity"}}       // drive any widget by name
{"method": "ui.pointer",       "params": {"events": [{"kind":"down","x":0.2,"y":0.3}, {"kind":"up","x":0.4,"y":0.3}]}}
{"method": "ui.screenshot",    "params": {"path": "after.png"}}
```

- **Command registry.** `engine.commands` lists the available commands; `develop.controls` lists every slider's
  range, default and current value.
- **MCP server.** `lightcraft-cli mcp` exposes the command registry to Claude (or any MCP client), alongside
  helpers for import, query, develop, mask, render (returned as an image) and export. It runs headless, or attached
  to the running app with screenshots, clicks and gestures. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

  ```sh
  cargo build --release -p lightcraft-cli
  claude mcp add lightcraft -- "$PWD/target/release/lightcraft-cli" mcp ~/Pictures/shoot          # headless
  claude mcp add lightcraft-app -- "$PWD/target/release/lightcraft-cli" mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7980  # live app
  ```
- **Scriptable CLI:** `lightcraft-cli run --import in.dng develop.set control=light.exposure value=0.7 app.export
  path=out.jpg longEdge=2048` runs any chain of commands (headless, on a saved library, or against the running app)
  and prints one JSON result per command; `lightcraft-cli render in.dng -o out.jpg --set light.exposure=0.7 --preset …`.
- **Undo for everything**, including agent actions: a slider drag (or a scripted burst of updates) is one undo step.
- **Every widget is addressable** (`ui.widgets`) and clickable by name, so agents operate the real UI, not a
  side door.
- The screenshots in this README were produced end to end by the [`docs/showcase/`](docs/showcase/) scripts.
  Protocol reference: [docs/control-protocol.md](docs/control-protocol.md).

<br>

## Fast, native, private

- **Pure Rust, no C.** Our own RAW decoders (DNG, Canon CR2, Sony ARW, Nikon NEF, Fujifilm RAF incl. X-Trans,
  Panasonic RW2 / Leica RWL, Pentax PEF, Olympus ORF), our own colour science, our own pipeline. JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP,
  PSD composites and JPEG XL open today.
- **Scene-referred & wide-gamut.** Linear Rec.2020 float internally, Bradford-adapted white balance, gamut mapping
  instead of clipping, a filmic shoulder for raw and pixel-exact pass-through for JPEGs you haven't touched.
- **Resolution-independent edits.** Radii and brush sizes are relative to the image, so a 400 px preview, your
  5K display and a 60 MP export look the same.
- **GPU-accelerated, CPU-exact.** The whole develop pipeline runs as wgpu compute kernels (Metal / Vulkan / DX12),
  checked against the CPU pipeline to within 1/255. On a 24 MP raw (Apple M4 Pro): a slider update re-renders in
  ~4 ms, a cold 2.5 MP loupe in ~30 ms, and a full-size export in ~0.3 s including a parallel JPEG encode.
  Without a GPU the same pipeline runs on all CPU cores, redoing only the stages a slider affects.
- **Instant culling.** Opening a raw shows its embedded camera preview or cached render within ~0.1 s while the
  full render follows (~0.2–0.5 s for 24 MP). The next and previous photos are prepared in the background, so stepping
  through a shoot takes ~50 ms per photo.
- **Background rendering.** A worker pool renders the loupe, before/after and every visible thumbnail off the UI
  thread: drafts during drags, full quality on release.
- **Local-first.** No account, no cloud, no telemetry, no subscription. Your catalog is an append-only log of
  human-readable operations you can diff, back up or replay.

## Feature status

LightCraft is young and moving fast. **Where we honestly stand** (details in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md#where-we-stand)):

- **By feature count we're at ~79%** of Lightroom (core features 98%), tracked row by row in
  [docs/parity.md](docs/parity.md).
- **As a day-to-day Lightroom replacement we're nearer 60–70%.** It's great for JPEG/DNG and most Nikon / Sony /
  older-Canon raws on one machine.
- **The biggest gaps:**
  - **camera colour calibration:** raws other than DNG develop with a neutral colour matrix today, so colour is muted;
  - **CR3 and compressed Fujifilm / Olympus raws:** these open as embedded previews only;
  - **AI masks and denoise:** subject and sky selection are classical heuristics;
  - **HDR, video and the Classic Print / Book / Map modules.**
- **What's next:** see [where we're going](ROADMAP.md#where-were-going).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/lightcraft && cd lightcraft
cargo run --release -p lightcraft                       # opens your library (~/Pictures/LightCraft Library; a new one starts with demo photos)
cargo run --release -p lightcraft -- ~/Pictures/trip    # import your photos (folders are scanned, duplicates skipped)
cargo run --release -p lightcraft -- --memory           # a throwaway in-memory demo session (writes nothing)
cargo run --release -p lightcraft -- --control 7980     # with the automation channel
cargo xtask web --serve                                 # the same app in the browser: http://127.0.0.1:8080/
cargo run --release -p lightcraft-cli -- render photo.jpg -o out.jpg --set light.exposure=0.5
cargo xtask ci                                          # fmt, clippy, tests, layering, wasm checks
```

CI defaults to line-table debug information and one build job per 1.5 GB of RAM
available when it starts (at most one per CPU; 4 if memory can't be read), so an
8 GB machine with 6 GB free builds with 4, and a busy machine with little free
builds with fewer. Test threads follow, capped at 4. Full-debuginfo linkers, one
per CPU, otherwise exhaust RAM before any test runs. GPU coverage is unchanged. Explicit
`CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` and `RUST_TEST_THREADS` settings
override these defaults. Ordinary development commands keep their own settings.

**Chinese and Japanese text** need the shared font repo, an optional build input (official releases always include it):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts ../craft-fonts
CRAFT_FONTS_DIR=../craft-fonts cargo run --release -p lightcraft
```

Without it LightCraft builds and runs the same, but Chinese and Japanese text have no glyphs. Fonts are never committed to this
repo; see [craftrules `standards/fonts.md`](https://github.com/storytold/craftrules/blob/main/standards/fonts.md).

**Interface language:** **Edit → Language** (English, 简体中文, 繁體中文（台灣）, 日本語) or **Settings → General →
Language**; the choice applies immediately and persists. See [docs/localization.md](docs/localization.md).

The web build needs the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and the matching `wasm-bindgen` CLI
(`cargo xtask web` prints the exact install command); see [docs/web.md](docs/web.md).

**Nix** builds the desktop app and `lightcraft-cli` (the Nix build always includes the craft-fonts input, so Japanese
text has glyphs):

```sh
nix run github:storytold/lightcraft                    # the desktop app
nix build github:storytold/lightcraft                  # → ./result/bin/{lightcraft,lightcraft-cli}
nix develop github:storytold/lightcraft                # rust toolchain + native deps + fonts
```

In a flake configuration (NixOS, home-manager, nix-darwin):

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs.lightcraft.url = "github:storytold/lightcraft";
# optional: build against your own nixpkgs instead of the one LightCraft pins
# inputs.lightcraft.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

# then, in a NixOS or home-manager module (where `inputs` is in scope):
nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.lightcraft.overlays.default ];   # makes `pkgs.lightcraft` available
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.lightcraft ];           # home-manager: home.packages = [ pkgs.lightcraft ];
```

`nix build` installs the same desktop file, hicolor icons and AppStream metadata as the .deb/.rpm, and runs
`cargo test --workspace` as its check phase (skip it with `pkgs.lightcraft.overrideAttrs { doCheck = false; }`).

**Keyboard:** <kbd>G</kbd> grid · <kbd>D</kbd> detail · <kbd>E</kbd> edit · <kbd>C</kbd> crop · <kbd>M</kbd> masking ·
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> presets · <kbd>\\</kbd> original · <kbd>Y</kbd> before/after · <kbd>Z</kbd> zoom ·
<kbd>J</kbd> clipping · <kbd>⌘Z</kbd> undo · <kbd>⌘/</kbd> all shortcuts.

## How it's built

An engine-first Cargo workspace of small, tested crates with enforced layering (`cargo xtask layers`): `geom`,
`color`, `raster`, `tiff` → `raw`, `codecs`, `meta`, `develop` → `pipeline` → `catalog` → `engine` → `ui-egui`. The
egui frontend is one swappable crate; nothing below it knows a UI exists. `mcp` and the apps (`lightcraft`,
`lightcraft-cli`) sit on top of `engine`.

## Contributing

Humans and agents follow the same rules, so read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first. The short version:

- **Clean-room.** Never read Adobe binaries or GPL raw/photo code (darktable, RawTherapee, LibRaw, rawspeed, dcraw…);
  work from public specs and black-box observation.
- **No Adobe assets, ever:** no icons, screenshots, presets, profiles, LUTs or fonts from Adobe products. Every
  image, icon and font in the repo is original, public domain, Creative Commons, OFL or permissively licensed, and has
  an entry in [assets/ATTRIBUTION.md](assets/ATTRIBUTION.md) added in the same commit. New fonts go to
  [storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), not here.
- **Pure Rust**, enforced crate layering, everything is a command, and `cargo xtask ci` green before every commit
  (one task id per commit).
- **Never crash.** Non-test code returns errors instead of panicking: no `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!` or
  `unsafe`, checked indexing on anything derived from input, and a regression test with every crash fix. Details in
  [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#never-crash-outranks-feature-work).
