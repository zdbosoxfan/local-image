# AI masks (Object and Describe)

LightCraft selects objects with **SAM 3** (Segment Anything with Concepts, Meta 2025), run in
pure Rust by `crates/segment` on [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle): on the GPU
through Metal on macOS, on the CPU elsewhere (for now).

**The model is optional.** It is not part of LightCraft, and nothing requires it: without it,
Object and Describe offer to download it, every other feature (and every existing mask, see
below) works, and no render, export or command ever waits for it.

## Using them

In the Masking panel (M):

- **Object**: click the thing you want; every click refines the selection. ⌥-click (Alt) a part
  to leave it out. Clicks show as green (include) and red (leave out) dots.
- **Describe**: type what to select — `sky`, `trees`, `the red car` — and press Return. Every
  instance the model finds (score above 0.5) joins the mask; if nothing matches, nothing is
  created and you are told so.
- Several things at once: `car, road` (comma-separated) selects each and merges them.
- **+ / −** under the selected mask (and the Add / Subtract / Intersect menus) combine
  selections: Describe `car`, click the mask, + ▸ Describe… `road`; − ▸ Describe… `people` takes
  the people out of a sky mask; − ▸ Object then clicks remove one object.
- **Edge** (per selection, −100…100): below 0 a crisper border, above 0 a feathered one (up to 2 %
  of the long edge, so previews and exports match).
- **Detail:** about a second after the last click (or right after a description), the photo
  around the selection is analyzed again, zoomed in, from a sharper source (~5 s on an M4 Pro,
  in the background); the result is kept as a high-resolution patch (at most 4 per selection),
  so small objects get 5–10× finer edges than one pass over the whole photo gives.

The first Object or Describe on a photo analyzes it (the image encoder runs once per photo and
look: ~3 s on an Apple M4 Pro, plus a one-time ~6 s for compiling GPU kernels and loading the
model after launch). That starts in the background as soon as you pick Object; after it, each
click takes ~35 ms and each description ~0.6 s. Everything the model does runs on its own worker
thread: the window stays responsive, a click shows its dot at once and the selection follows
when it's computed ("Selecting…" / "Analyzing the photo…" under the mask tiles). The model is
unloaded after 10 minutes without use (it takes several GB of memory) and loaded again when
needed.

The result is stored with the mask: the model's 288 × 288 mask logits over the uncropped photo
(quantized, compressed, ~10–30 KB). Renders and exports sample them at any resolution and never
need the model, so masks survive moving the library to a machine without it, and the web build
renders them. Editing the photo's look later does not recompute a mask (click again to update).

## Getting the model

### In the app (recommended)

The first time you pick Object or Describe without the model, LightCraft asks:

> **Download the SAM 3 model?** Object and Describe masks use SAM 3, Meta's segmentation model.
> It isn't part of LightCraft, and everything else works without it. Download it once (about
> 3.4 GB) · *folder*. Licence: SAM License (Meta) — Meta's terms, not LightCraft's. Downloading
> it means accepting them. [Read the SAM License] — **Not Now** / **Download**

Nothing is downloaded until you choose **Download**. The download runs in the background (close
the dialog and keep working; the Masking panel shows its progress), can be cancelled, resumes
where it stopped if interrupted (also after quitting), and tries the next download location when
one fails or stalls. Each file is written as `<name>.part` and moved into the model folder only
when complete and verified — `model.safetensors` must have the exact size and SHA-256 of Meta's
official checkpoint; a file that doesn't match is deleted, never used. If no location works, the
dialog says why and LightCraft carries on without the model.

Agents and scripts use the same commands (control channel, `lightcraft-cli mcp --connect`):
`segment.model.status`, `segment.model.download {"acknowledged": true}` (refused without the
explicit `acknowledged`: pass it only after the user agreed to the download and the licence),
`segment.model.cancel`.

### Download locations

The model is fetched from an ordered list of mirrors: base URLs where `<base>/model.safetensors`,
`<base>/vocab.json` and `<base>/merges.txt` live. The list is, in order:

1. `LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_MIRRORS` (environment variable; URLs separated by commas or spaces);
2. the file `models/sam3-mirrors.txt` in LightCraft's settings folder (one URL per line, `#`
   comments) — `~/Library/Application Support/LightCraft/` (macOS), `%APPDATA%\LightCraft\`
   (Windows), `~/.config/lightcraft/` (Linux);
3. the built-in list, `DEFAULT_MIRRORS` in `crates/segment/src/fetch/mod.rs`.

> **Maintainers:** the built-in list is **empty** until LightCraft's own CDN locations exist
> (see the `TODO(maintainer)` there): add them in order of preference, host the three files
> unchanged, and pin `vocab.json` / `merges.txt` (size + SHA-256) in `SAM3_FILES` at the same
> time. Until then the in-app download needs a user-configured mirror, and the dialog says so.

Hugging Face's `facebook/sam3` can't be a default: it is **gated** (each person must accept the
licence there, wait for approval and download with their own token). Someone with access can
use it as their mirror:

```sh
LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_MIRRORS=https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3/resolve/main \
LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_TOKEN=hf_... lightcraft
```

(`LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_TOKEN` is sent as a bearer token only over https, and only to the mirror's own
host — not to the storage host it redirects to.)

The download is plain HTTP/1.1 over TLS in pure Rust (rustls with the RustCrypto provider and
the Mozilla root certificates; no OpenSSL, `ring` or `aws-lc`, nothing compiled from C), with a
15 s connect timeout and a 30 s stall timeout; it follows redirects but doesn't use HTTP proxies.

### By hand

Put `model.safetensors`, `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` from `facebook/sam3` in the model folder:
`models/sam3/` in the settings folder above, or the folder `LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_DIR` names. Developers
can use the installer scripts, which download from Hugging Face with your token and verify the
weights:

```sh
HF_TOKEN=hf_... tools/install-sam3.sh            # macOS, Linux
tools/install-sam3.sh --check                     # verify an installation
```

```powershell
$env:HF_TOKEN = "hf_..."; .\tools\install-sam3.ps1   # Windows
```

## Licence of the model

LightCraft's code is MIT OR Apache-2.0; `crates/segment` (a port of Apache-2.0 code) is
Apache-2.0. **The SAM 3 weights are neither**: they are Meta's, released under the **SAM
License** (<https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3/blob/main/LICENSE>), a custom licence that
is not an OSI open-source licence. It grants a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable,
royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, distribute, copy, modify and create derivative works of
the "SAM Materials", subject to its terms, including: anyone redistributing them must provide a
copy of the licence with them, and derivative works are distributed under its terms; uses
subject to ITAR, military or warfare purposes, nuclear industries, espionage, guns or illegal
weapons, and reverse engineering are prohibited, and trade controls (sanctions, export rules)
apply; the materials come "as is", without warranty; Meta may terminate the licence on a breach
(then the materials must be deleted); California law governs. Read the licence itself — this
summary is not legal advice.

Therefore:

- **The weights are never part of this repository, its releases or installers**, and must not be
  committed.
- They reach a user's computer only when that user asks for them, after the dialog names the
  licence (or when they install them by hand).
- Whoever hosts a mirror redistributes the SAM Materials and must follow the licence (ship it
  next to the files).

## Commands (control channel, MCP)

| Command | Params | |
|---|---|---|
| `mask.add` | `{kind: "object", points?: [[x,y],…], exclude?: [[x,y],…], seg?}` | an Object mask (empty until clicked) |
| `mask.add` | `{kind: "prompt", text, seg?}` | a Describe mask |
| `mask.addComponent` | `{op: add\|subtract\|intersect, kind: "object"\|"prompt", …}` | the same as a component |
| `mask.objectPoint` | `{x, y, exclude?: bool, id?}` | one click on the selected mask's Object selection (≤ 64 clicks) |
| `mask.refineDetail` | `{id?, component?}` | the zoomed-in detail pass → `{started}` |
| `segment.prepare` | `{}` | load the model and analyze the active photo → `{busy}` |
| `segment.model.status` | `{}` | `{available, installed, dir, loaded, busy, analyzing, sizeBytes, license, licenseUrl, mirrors, download}` |
| `segment.model.download` | `{acknowledged: true}` | start the download in the background → `{started}` |
| `segment.model.cancel` | `{}` | stop it (it resumes next time) → `{cancelled}` |

Coordinates are normalized to the uncropped, oriented photo, like every mask shape. `seg` passes
a stored segmentation (as `mask.list` / the develop settings hold it): the mask is made without
the model. Without the model, the AI kinds fail with an error starting "The SAM 3 model is not
installed" that says how to get it.

In the desktop app the commands don't wait for the model: `mask.objectPoint` returns
`{pending: true}` and the selection is applied when it's computed (one undo step per settled
selection); `mask.add {kind: "prompt"}` returns `{pending: true}` and the mask appears when
something is found (or a message says nothing was). `lightcraft-cli` and the headless MCP server
wait and return the result (when built with the `sam` feature; the default CLI has no AI masks).

## Implementation notes

- `crates/segment` ports the Hugging Face `transformers` implementation (Apache-2.0; see
  `NOTICE` — the ported files say so and that they were modified): the 32-layer ViT backbone
  with 2-D RoPE and windowed attention, the feature pyramids, the SAM 2-style prompt encoder and
  two-way mask decoder for clicks, and the CLIP text encoder, DETR encoder/decoder (box
  relative-position bias, presence token) and pixel decoder for text. The CLIP tokenizer is a
  small BPE in `tokenizer.rs`. The downloader (original code) is the `lightcraft-fetch` crate, shared by any model that is downloaded; `fetch/` here says what SAM 3 needs.
- candle is pinned at 0.9.2: later releases make `candle-core` depend on `tokenizers` with the
  Oniguruma C library, and the product is pure Rust. Weights are read with positional reads (no
  memory map: `unsafe` stays in `lightcraft-sysmem`), only the tensors a path needs, and every
  tensor's byte range is checked against the file's length when it is opened (a truncated or
  damaged file is an error, never a crash).
- The engine (`crates/engine/src/segment/`) owns one worker thread with the model and the last
  encoded photo; the session sends it jobs and receives results over channels, never holding a
  lock the model holds. Each job runs under `catch_unwind`: a panic inside candle becomes an
  error and the model is reloaded on the next request; busy counters are reset by drop guards.
- Hostile documents: a selection keeps at most 4 detail patches (when read and when rendered),
  each at most 1024² logits; more than 64 clicks are never sent to the model.
- Accuracy: `crates/segment/tests/reference.rs` compares every stage against the Python
  reference (`tools/sam3_reference.py`); on Metal the backbone matches to 7e-5 relative error
  and masks to ~5e-5. f16 was tried and rejected (overflow, ~7 % faster).
- The engine feature `sam` (on in the desktop app, off for web and CLI) gates the model; without
  it the commands report that the build has no AI masks.

**Developers:** the accuracy test against the Python reference needs `torch` and
`transformers` (`tools/requirements-sam3-reference.txt`):

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv-sam3 && .venv-sam3/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements-sam3-reference.txt
.venv-sam3/bin/python tools/sam3_reference.py photo.jpg ref.safetensors
LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_DIR=<model dir> LIGHTCRAFT_SAM3_REF=ref.safetensors cargo test -p lightcraft-segment --release -- --nocapture
```
