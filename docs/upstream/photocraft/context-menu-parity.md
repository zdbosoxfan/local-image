# Context-menu parity contract

Status: implementation contract, updated 2026-10-07. Scope: canvas, document tabs, and panels. “Right-click” means a secondary pointer click; macOS Control-click should also open the same menu where the platform sends a context-menu gesture. Photoshop changes a context menu with the active tool, selection, and panel item. Adobe documents that principle but does not publish a complete current menu catalog. **Documented** means an Adobe source explicitly names the gesture or action. **Inferred** means a PhotoCraft design target or an item known from a main menu whose presence in a Photoshop context menu still needs a current-product capture. Do not present inferred rows as exact Photoshop menus. [Adobe: panels and menus](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/panels-menus.html), [Adobe: shortcuts and context menus](https://helpx.adobe.com/sa_en/photoshop/using/customizing-keyboard-shortcuts.html).

## Dispatch contract

1. Hit-test the target before opening: modal operation/handle, text selection, canvas content, panel row or icon, tab, then empty workspace. A generic canvas menu must not swallow a more specific target.
2. Snapshot the target and selection when the menu opens. A row in an existing multiselection acts on that set; a row outside it becomes the target before its command runs. Apply the same rule to layers, channels, paths, and presets.
3. Resolve items from a pure menu model keyed by target kind, active tool, document state, platform, and active operation. The model supplies label, command id, params, enabled state, and reason. Every mutating item dispatches an engine command; view-only items may update shell state. An unavailable feature is disabled with a reason or omitted, never a clickable no-op.
4. Preserve primary-button tool behavior. Secondary click only opens a menu unless a right-button drag gesture or the user's explicit right-erase preference owns the gesture. A drag must not briefly open a menu, and opening a menu must never paint, transform, sample, or commit.
5. Anchor at the pointer and clamp to the viewport; support keyboard context-menu key/Shift+F10 where available, Escape/outside click, separators only between nonempty groups, checked/radio state, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader labels.
6. Use the same command id and enablement as the menu bar/options bar. Provide UI inspection data and control-channel operations to select a menu item without pixel coordinates, while retaining real pointer tests and screenshots.
7. Test each menu model independently for conditional rows and wrong-state safety; test actual secondary-click routing, menu selection, undo/redo, and no accidental primary action.

## Canvas tool matrix

The “PhotoCraft at branch point” column records behavior before this PR. Picker means the Brush Preset quick picker in paint_mouse.rs; Layers means the hit-tested layer list in layer_pick_ui.rs. Command/Ctrl + secondary-click opens the layer list with every tool, and Move opens it without a modifier. Exact Photoshop secondary-click items beyond Adobe-documented rows are **proposed** until captured from current Photoshop.

| Tool(s) in PhotoCraft | Photoshop / desired contextual action | PhotoCraft at branch point | Priority, evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Move | Choose a layer at the point; an auto-select choice also exists in the options bar | Layers | P0; [Adobe layer movement](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/moving-stacking-locking-layers.html); exact pop-up layout requires capture |
| Rectangular/Elliptical Marquee, Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, Magnetic Lasso, Magic Wand, Quick Selection, Object Selection | Active selection: the 2026 selection menu (see *Selection canvas reference* below); no selection: making a selection | Quick Selection: Picker (a brush tool, as in Photoshop); the other six: the selection menu below (#614, #738) | P1; no-selection variant still needs a dated capture |
| Crop | During crop: ratio/preset, overlay, clear/reset, commit/cancel **(inferred context placement)** | No tool menu | P1; pending crop target |
| Eyedropper | Sample-size/source choices **(inferred)** | No tool menu | P2; [Adobe illustration uses Eyedropper](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/panels-menus.html), but does not publish item text |
| Ruler, Note, Count | Unit / measurement, note edit/delete, count-group operations **(inferred)** | No tool menu | P2 |
| Brush, Pencil, Eraser, Background Eraser, Spot Healing, Healing, Clone Stamp, History Brush, Blur, Sharpen, Smudge, Dodge, Burn, Sponge | Brush preset, size and hardness where applicable | Picker | P0; [Adobe Brush Settings](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/desktop/apply-painting-techniques/brushes-presets/create-brush-set-painting-options.html). Alt+secondary-drag on Windows and Control+Option-drag on macOS adjust size/hardness ([Adobe cursor shortcuts](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/photoshop/desktop/get-started/settings-and-preferences/change-tool-pointers.html)) |
| Gradient, Paint Bucket | Gradient preset/type/mode or fill source/tolerance **(inferred context placement)** | No tool menu | P1 |
| Type | In text: cut/copy/paste, spelling suggestions, text formatting; outside text: type-layer action **(inferred context placement)** | No tool menu | P1; separate editing and nonediting states; [Adobe type editing](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/desktop/text-typography/get-started-with-text/edit-text.html) |
| Hand, Zoom | Fit on Screen, 100%, 200%, Print Size; zoom step choices **(inferred context placement)** | No tool menu | P1; view actions stay out of document history |
| Pen, Path Selection | Path/point actions, Make Selection, Fill/Stroke Path, Free Transform Path **(inferred context placement)** | Pen canvas right-click follows the user-provided 20-row Photoshop capture below. Paths rows offer Make Selection, Fill and Stroke. Path Selection's own canvas menu remains open. | P1; distinguish node, segment, path, and blank canvas |
| Rectangle, Ellipse Shape, Triangle, Polygon, Line, Custom Shape | Shape/path operations, fill/stroke settings, transform **(inferred context placement)** | No tool menu | P2 |
| Slice, Slice Select | Slice properties, duplicate/delete, divide, guides **(inferred context placement)** | No tool menu | P2 |
| Any tool while Free Transform is active | Scale, Rotate, Skew, Distort, Perspective, Warp, rotate/flip variants, commit/cancel **(inferred exact context placement)** | Missing per docs/scorecard.md TOOL-214-5 | P0; transform operations [documented by Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/desktop/crop-resize-transform/transform-manipulate-reshape/adjust-scale-rotation-and-perspective.html); type restrictions [documented here](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/creating-type.html) |
| Any tool with Command/Ctrl + secondary click | List visible layers with pixels under pointer | Layers | P0; preserve existing route |

The layer-list menu on an empty pixel or all-hidden hit should be empty/closed; it must not select a transparent or hidden layer. The right-erase preference is an alternate PhotoCraft behavior, and its selected state takes precedence over the Brush picker only for Brush/Eraser.

## Pen canvas reference capture (2026-10-07)

The user supplied a Photoshop screenshot of a closed path in Path mode. The table preserves every row in its order; separator boundaries appear between the groups. Gray rows in that capture remain visible but disabled for a plain work path. Enablement changes with the active shape layer, saved path, copied style, and symmetry state. Ellipsis rows open a parameter dialog before changing the document.

| Group | Rows in screenshot order | PhotoCraft action and applicability |
|---|---|---|
| Path | Create Vector Mask; Delete Path | `layer.vectorMask.fromPath` on an eligible layer; `path.delete` on a work/saved path |
| Preset | Define Custom Shape… | `edit.defineCustomShape` with a name dialog |
| Selection/paint | Make Selection…; New Guides From Shape; Fill Path…; Stroke Path… | `path.toSelection` dialog; `view.newGuidesFromShape` for shape layers; `path.fill` and `path.stroke` dialogs on pixel layers |
| Export | Clipping Path… | `path.clippingPath.set` on a saved path, with flatness parameter |
| Geometry | Free Transform Path | `path.transform` with translation, scale and rotation parameters |
| Shape operation | Unite Shapes; Subtract Front Shape; Unite Shapes at Overlap; Subtract Shapes at Overlap | The four `layer.combineShapes.*` operations on shape layers with multiple components |
| Copy style | Copy Fill; Copy Complete Stroke | `path.style.copyFill` / `copyStroke` when the shape has that style |
| Paste style | Paste Fill; Paste Complete Stroke | `path.style.pasteFill` / `pasteStroke` when a matching style has been copied |
| Layer view | Isolate Layers | `select.isolateLayers` for an active layer |
| Symmetry | Make Symmetry Path; Disable Symmetry Path | `paint.symmetryFromPath` on a path; `paint.symmetryDisable` when symmetry is active |

The reference does not establish Photoshop's behavior for right-clicks on a single anchor, a segment, or empty canvas; these still need separate captures. PhotoCraft's disabled rows do not call a command.

## Selection canvas reference (2026-10-08)

Right-click with a Marquee, Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, Magic Wand or Object Selection tool. Rows keep the command id, dialog and enablement of their menu-bar twins (`canvas_tool_menu::SELECTION_MENU`); a greyed row never runs.

| Group | Rows with an active selection (Photoshop 2026 order) | PhotoCraft command |
|---|---|---|
| Selection | Deselect; Select Inverse; Feather…; Select and Mask… | `select.deselect`, `select.inverse`, `select.modify.feather`, `select.selectAndMask` |
| Store | Save Selection…; Make Work Path… | `select.saveSelection`; `select.toWorkPath` after a Tolerance dialog |
| Layer | Layer via Copy; Layer via Cut; New Layer… | `layer.new.layerViaCopy`, `layer.new.layerViaCut`, `layer.new.layer` |
| Transform | Free Transform; Transform Selection; Distort; Perspective | `edit.freeTransform`, `select.transformSelection`, `edit.transform.distort`, `edit.transform.perspective` |
| Fill | Fill…; Stroke…; Content-Aware Fill… | `edit.fill`, `edit.stroke`, `edit.contentAwareFill` |
| Filter | Last Filter | `filter.lastFilter` |
| Fade | Fade… | `edit.fade` |

Photoshop's Generative Fill and Delete and Fill Selection rows are left out: PhotoCraft has no such commands. With nothing selected the menu offers Select All, Reselect, Color Range… and Load Selection… (`NO_SELECTION_MENU`). Adobe-adjacent sources document Color Range there; the other rows are **inferred** until a dated capture confirms them.

## Delivery slices and acceptance

1. Core routing: target hit-test, menu model, keyboard accessibility, control inspection, conflict rules. Existing Move layer list and painting picker remain functional.
2. Canvas high frequency: selection, Free Transform, Type, Hand/Zoom, Gradient/Paint Bucket. Add rows only where the underlying command works. Record exact Photoshop label/order/disabled-state captures before declaring 1:1 parity.
3. Panels: Paths row actions, document tabs and distinct layer eye/thumbnail/mask/effect targets; finish Brushes export and observed channels/preset gaps. Adobe [documents the eye-icon visibility gesture](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/photoshop/using/default-keyboard-shortcuts/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts.pdf).
4. Long tail: shape/path, crop, metadata and specialist tools. Keep a per-tool fixture with no selection, active selection, masked/locked layer, and active operation where applicable.

Each slice needs pure model tests (including every item dispatching a known command), UI pointer tests for secondary click and modifier precedence, command/undo tests, a disabled-state test, and screenshots from PhotoCraft with the menu actually open. Compare labels, order, and state against dated Photoshop screenshots; a screenshot of a different tool or menu bar is insufficient evidence. Maintain a checklist beside each captured reference: Photoshop version/platform, target description, tool, selection/document state, modifiers, and exact items observed.
