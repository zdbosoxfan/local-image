//! Pen tablet input that the windowing layer (winit 0.30) drops: pressure, tilt, barrel rotation
//! and which end of the pen is down (tip or eraser).
//!
//! - **macOS** ([`macos::Monitor`]): an AppKit local event monitor reads the tablet fields of
//!   each `NSEvent` (`pressure`, `tilt`, `rotation`, `subtype`, and `pointingDeviceType` from
//!   proximity events) before winit sees the event, so every pointer event the UI handles already
//!   has its pen sample. AppKit's block-based monitor API needs Objective-C interop, so
//!   `macos.rs` is the only module in the workspace that allows `unsafe` (craftrules
//!   never-crash: an isolated, tested helper crate).
//! - **Linux X11** ([`x11::spawn`]): a second, pure-Rust X connection (x11rb) selects XInput2
//!   raw events on the root window and maps the tablet device's valuators ("Abs Pressure",
//!   "Abs Tilt X/Y", "Abs Rotary Z") to samples. Raw events reach every client that asks, also
//!   while winit holds the pointer grab of a drag. No `unsafe`.
//! - **Wayland**: not covered. The `zwp_tablet_v2` protocol has to be bound on winit's own
//!   `wl_display` connection (the tablet events name winit's `wl_surface`), which needs
//!   `unsafe` foreign-display interop, and binding it makes compositors stop emulating the
//!   pointer for the pen, so pen motion would have to be re-injected into egui as well.
//!
//! The platform glue only reads raw values and hands them to the pure mapping in [`appkit`] and
//! [`xi`], which normalise, clamp and track pen state and are tested on every platform.
//!
//! A sample is reported through a callback: `Some(sample)` while a pen is in use (hovering or
//! touching), `None` when the pointer is a mouse again.
