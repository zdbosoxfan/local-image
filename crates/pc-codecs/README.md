# photocraft-codecs

Codecs for flat raster image formats, written in pure Rust. The crate is standalone: it depends on no other
workspace crate and defines its own `Image` type. It also builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and
does no I/O: decoders take `&[u8]` and encoders return `Vec<u8>`.

It follows the "avoid GIMP's hole" rules in `plan/architecture.md` §1.1:

* **Symmetric.** Every format we write, we can also read. The only exceptions are listed in
  `ASYMMETRIC_EXCEPTIONS`, each with a reason. The test suite checks this.
* **Depth-preserving.** An image can hold U8, U16, F16 or F32 samples, and each format keeps
  what it can hold.
* **Metadata-preserving.** ICC, EXIF, XMP, DPI and text are kept wherever the format supports
  them.
* **Honest.** `caps(format)` says what each format holds, and
  `fidelity_warnings(&image, format)` lists what an export will lose before you write it. Both
  functions use the same encode plan as `encode`, so a warning appears exactly when the file
  changes. On the way in, `Image::warnings` lists what the decoded image doesn't show: frames or
  pages left out, or data that ended early.

```rust
use photocraft_codecs::*;

let img = decode(&bytes)?;                               // detect + decode (default Limits)
for w in fidelity_warnings(&img, Format::Jpeg) {         // e.g. "16-bit will be reduced to 8-bit"
    println!("{w}");
}
let out = encode(&img, Format::Tiff, &EncodeOptions::default())?;
```

"Native" means the data is stored and read back without conversion. Anything else is converted by
the encode plan, and `fidelity_warnings` reports the conversion when it loses information:

* A float image written to an integer format goes to U16 where the format supports it. Values
  outside 0..1 raise `RangeClipped`.
* Integer data written to a float-only format (EXR, HDR) becomes F32 without loss.
* CMYK is converted to RGB with a naive formula that is not colour-managed. `CmykConverted` is
  raised and the ICC profile is dropped, because a CMYK profile does not describe RGB data.
* Gray written to an RGB-only format is expanded to RGB without loss, so no warning is raised.

`Image::convert` applies the same ICC rule: it keeps the profile only when the colour model stays
the same.

## Documented asymmetries and limitations

* **Camera raw files** (DNG, CR2, NEF, ARW… which are TIFF-structured) are recognised and refused
  with `CodecError::Unsupported`: they are sensor data, not flat images. `photocraft-raw` decodes
  and develops them, and `photocraft-io` routes them there.

* **HEIF/HEIC (read-only, feature `heif`).** Decoding lives in the optional `photocraft-heif` crate
  behind the non-default `heif` feature (official PhotoCraft builds enable it; distributors choose).
  Without it, HEIF is still detected and decoding returns `CodecError::Unsupported` ("HEIC/HEIF
  support isn't included in this build"). iPhone and Mac photos decode with `heic-rs` (pure Rust, no `unsafe`):
  single pictures and grid-tiled photos, 8 to 12 bits, auxiliary alpha, ICC, EXIF and XMP. The
  container's `irot`/`imir`/`clap` are applied and EXIF Orientation is rewritten to 1 (HEIF's EXIF
  tag only repeats the container's, and applying both would turn the photo twice). Grayscale
  decodes to RGB. Image sequences, overlays and identity derivations, multilayer HEVC and some
  4:2:2/4:4:4 streams return `CodecError::Unsupported` or `Malformed`, never wrong pixels. Writing
  needs an HEVC encoder and every mature one is C, so HEIF is listed in `ASYMMETRIC_EXCEPTIONS`.
* **AVIF.** Encoding uses `ravif`, which is pure Rust. Decoding
  needs `dav1d`, which is C. AVIF is therefore read-unsupported, and write support is gated
  behind the non-default `avif` feature. In a default build it is neither readable nor writable,
  so the symmetric guarantee holds. It is listed in `ASYMMETRIC_EXCEPTIONS`.
* **Lossy WebP.** There is no pure-Rust lossy WebP encoder. We always write lossless WebP, and
  `webp_lossless: false` returns `CodecError::Unsupported`. We can read both lossy and lossless
  files.
* **Animation and multi-page files** (APNG, animated GIF/WebP, multi-page TIFF): only the first
  frame or page is decoded, and a single frame is written. `FormatCaps::animation` marks
  containers that can hold more frames. The decoded image then carries a
  `DecodeWarning::MoreFrames` / `MorePages` in `Image::warnings`, with the total when the file
  states it (frames and TIFF directories are counted without decoding them; reduced-resolution
  TIFF directories and transparency masks are not pages). Any TIFF page can still be opened
  with `decode_tiff_page` (and `photocraft_io::import_tiff_page`).
* **EXIF in TIFF** is stored as a sub-IFD rather than a blob, so it is not preserved yet.
  `caps.exif = false` for TIFF, and a warning is raised.
* **Orientation** (EXIF tag 274 in JPEG, PNG `eXIf` and WebP; the decoded page's tag in TIFF and
  BigTIFF) is applied on
  decode, like Photoshop: the pixels come back upright and the EXIF/XMP orientation is rewritten
  to 1 (`DecodeOptions::keep_orientation` opts out). Encoders always write Orientation = 1
  (`upright_exif`, `upright_xmp`, which change only the tag's value, kept in its own type), so upright pixels
  are never rotated twice. Parsing is strict: an IFD0 inside the 8-byte header or cut off before
  its next-IFD pointer, an Orientation that is not exactly one SHORT or LONG, or an out-of-range value
  reads as 1; with duplicate entries the first wins. `Limits` are checked again on the upright
  size (5–8 swap width and height), and the rotated buffer is allocated fallibly.
  `Image::oriented` turns any layout and depth in parallel bands (about 10 ms for 24 MP RGB8 in
  release).
* **JPEG**
  * 8-bit only. Neither decoder backend supports 12-bit.
  * A file cut off inside its image data decodes leniently (a baseline JPEG's missing rows come
    out grey) but never silently: the image carries `DecodeWarning::Truncated`. A file that ends
    before any scan data is an error.
  * CMYK is always written 4:4:4 (subsampled CMYK is not portable) as Adobe-inverted CMYK with an
    APP14 marker.
  * Text is not written because there is no COM-segment support.
  * EXIF and XMP must each fit in one 64 KiB APP1 segment, otherwise the encoder returns an error.
    Extended XMP is not written.
* **TIFF decode**
  * Classic TIFF and BigTIFF (version 43, 8-byte offsets), both byte orders, strips or tiles,
    planar configuration 1 or 2.
  * Supports 1, 2 and 4-bit gray, 8/16/32/64-bit integers (32 and 64-bit are reduced to U16),
    F16, F32 and F64 (converted to F32), WhiteIsZero (#691: the tones are no longer inverted),
    palette images (opened as RGB), associated alpha (made straight) and extra samples (dropped
    unless the first is alpha).
  * Every directory is reachable: `tiff_info` lists the main IFD chain and its SubIFDs (tag 330)
    with each page's size, kind (page, reduced-resolution copy, mask) and storage, walked with a
    seen-set, a depth limit and a 10 000-directory cap; `decode_tiff_page` opens any of them.
    `decode` opens the first full-resolution page, like Photoshop (thumbnails are skipped).
  * Banded decoding: the image is allocated once at its final size and each strip or row of
    tiles is decoded straight into it, in parallel on native targets, with at most one
    strip/tile-sized scratch buffer per worker (30 MP RGB8: Deflate 345 → 32 ms, LZW 428 → 43
    ms in release). Image data cut off by the end of the file decodes with
    `DecodeWarning::Truncated`; a file far too small for its declared size (more than any
    compression could expand) is refused before allocating.
  * YCbCr, CIE Lab, signed integers and compressions that the `tiff` crate lacks (CCITT,
    JPEG-in-TIFF) return `Unsupported`.
* **TIFF encode** writes classic TIFF, or BigTIFF when `EncodeOptions::tiff_bigtiff` is set or
  the file could pass 4 GiB.
* **EXR**
  * Reads the first valid layer at full resolution, from its data window.
  * Channel names are matched by suffix, so `layer.R` counts as `R`.
  * Subsampled channels and deep data are unsupported.
  * Only lossless compressions are offered for writing: None, RLE, ZIP1, ZIP16 and PIZ.
* **Netpbm writing** picks the subtype from the image: float gives PFM, gray gives P5, RGB gives
  P6, and anything with alpha or CMYK gives P7 (PAM). Writing a `.pbm` file therefore produces
  whichever of these fits the data.
* **Colour conversions** (CMYK↔RGB, RGB→gray) are naive. Colour-managed conversion belongs in
  `photocraft-color`.

## Limits (decompression bombs)

`DecodeOptions { limits: Limits { max_width, max_height, max_pixels, max_alloc }, .. }` guards
decoding. Header dimensions are checked before the pixel buffer is allocated, and the budget is
also passed to the underlying decoders. A violation returns `CodecError::LimitExceeded`. The
defaults are 262144 px per side, 2^30 pixels and 8 GiB (2 GiB on 32-bit targets such as wasm).

## Tests

`cargo test -p photocraft-codecs` covers:

* the full round-trip matrix (every writable format × 4 sample types × 6 layouts), exact for
  lossless formats and above a PSNR threshold for lossy ones;
* metadata preservation per format, checked against `caps`;
* magic-number detection, including negatives;
* fidelity warnings, and a cross-check that the warnings match the actual round-trip result;
* the symmetric-capability guarantee;
* malformed input: truncation, bit flips and proptest random bytes;
* Adam7 PNG against progressive PNG and against the `image` crate as an oracle;
* limit enforcement.

If `corpus/pngsuite/*.png` exists at the repo root, every file in it is compared against the
`image` crate's decoder. Without it, that test is skipped.
