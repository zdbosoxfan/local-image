# Command-line interface

`apps/photocraft-cli` provides the following current subcommands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `convert` | Open one document and export it to another format |
| `info` | Print document size, mode, depth, and layer information as JSON |
| `run` | Open or create a document, execute engine commands, and optionally save |
| `batch` | Apply an action list to files in one input directory |
| `droplet` | Run a PhotoCraft droplet against files or folders |
| `commands` | List command IDs and parameter documentation |
| `mcp` | Start the MCP server on stdio, optionally bridged to the desktop app |
| `serve` | Start the JSON-lines headless server on stdio or loopback TCP |

Use `photocraft-cli --help` (or `photocraft-cli <subcommand> --help`) as the executable source of truth. A typical bounded command run is:

```sh
photocraft-cli run input.psd \
  --cmd image.adjustments.invert \
  --out output.png
```

Paths supplied to the current CLI are ordinary operating-system paths. The CLI does not restrict them to a workspace root. Batch output creates the requested output directory, and save operations may create parent directories. `batch` refuses an output directory that is its input directory (the results would replace the originals) unless `--in-place` is given. Run untrusted action files only in an appropriately isolated account or environment.

CLI parsing reports malformed flags and JSON as errors, and a flag the subcommand doesn't take (a typo such as `--fromat`) is a usage error (exit status 2) rather than being ignored. It is not a security policy layer. Engine commands remain responsible for validating their own parameters.
